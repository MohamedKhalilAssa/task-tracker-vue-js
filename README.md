# task-tracker
This is an Updated task tracker, that I made using Vue JS.\n
This was made with the help of TraversyMedia (Design, and helped me take my first steps in vue)\
\
The website uses the localStorage this time again, but with a few retouches that were made possible thanks to Vue's perfomance and vast features.

to have a look at it : [TaskTracker](https://task-tracker-vue-js-eight.vercel.app/)
